            <h3> First of all I don't even know your results but I am 100% sure that you have done everything you can 
                for your 3rd attempt.SO I do know that you did your best !. 
                I always knew you were smart as hell( but not smart as me girl , you know that right). 
                That's why you got 9 A's in your Ordinary Level exams.Not everyone can get 9A's.
                Then, you stumbled through the first and second A/l attempts.
                But I always believed in you,knowing that you would get it right on the third try.
                And I was right. I believed in you even when you said that you had a hard time in physics.
                (I still want to punch you in the face because you didnt ask for my help for that. Also I hope
                 that even if something like that happened again then you would ask for my help
                 , I am always free for you )
                So  finally what I want to say is that you did well and I am proud of you truly.
                Be proud of yourself and where you are right now. ,
                You achieved this all by yourself. You totally deserve it girl .               
                Congratulations again! I wish you the best of luck in everything you do!
